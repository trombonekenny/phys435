    "\n",
    "We (the Physics Department) are using Physics 435 this semester to try out a new teaching tool.  Our goal is to begin to understand how useful computer programming might be as an aid to understanding physics concepts and the behavior of physical systems.\n",
    "<p>\n",
    "<center><font color=red>Because this is an experiment, we need your feedback.  Don't be shy.</font></center>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Our Goals:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use simple Python to illustrate Physics examples.\n",
    "* Let you adjust the parameters of physical systems to learn about their behavior.\n",
    "* This is *not* a programming course.  You will not be expected to write programs from scratch.  Instead, you'll be given working code that you'll be able to modify in order to study its behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Brief Preliminaries\n",
    "We are using *iPython*, a web environment that allows us to serve normal web content intermixed with Python computer code.  The web page is  divided into cells, each containing either \"Markdown\" or \"Code\" content.  Right now, you are reading a Markdown cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open a document, a private copy is automatically created for you.  You can edit it without interfereing with what others see.  This allows you to modify the Python code (and the Markdown text, if you want), rerun it, and see the new results.  When you leave, your changes will be saved for later.\n",
    "\n",
    "To modify a code cell, click the cursor in it and edit it like any text document.  When you are done editing, you can see the new results by typing \"shift-enter\" or selecting \"Run\" from the Cell menu in the menubar.  Selecting \"Run All\" will execute the entire file."

    "OK, let's talk about Python.  It is a very versatile language, supporting everything from simple, calculator-like interactions to sophisticated object oriented programming.  \n",
    "\n",
    "This introduction describes most of the Python language that we'll use.  It is important to keep in mind that, because this is not intended to be a programming course, you are not expected to study it in detail.  The physics exercises and examples will already contain  functional code - you won't be expected to write programs from scratch.  Our plan is that you will be able to read and understand what the the code is doing and, by modifying the code and observing how the results vary, gain some intuition about the behavior of the physical systems that are being described.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python comes preloaded on many computers (those running Linux and Mac OSX, but not Windows).  You could run the Python examples on your computer, but you'd have to install some add-on numerical and graphics libraries, a complication that we want to avoid.  Hence this iPython environment, which you can use with any web browser.\n",
